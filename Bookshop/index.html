        <summary class="description">Darren Shan, Mr Crepsley and Vancha Marsch, are the hunters of the dusk. Their quarry - the Vampaneze Lord. But
             friends old and new may stand in their way... It is six years after Darren was made a Vampire Prince and following a grim prophesy made
              by Mr Tiny, the vampires know the ascension of the Vampaneze Lord is at hand. Mr Tiny warns the vampires that there will be only three
               opportunities for the Vampaneze Lord to be vanquished and only three vampires who may succeed: Vancha Marsch, Larten Crepsley...
               and Darren Shan. Leaving the enclave of Vampire Mountain, Harkat, Darren and Mr Crepsley are shadowed by a creature of the night, 
               do battle with the vampaneze, meet the mysterious Evanna and pay a visit to some old friends at the Cirque Du Freak. But no friend can 
               prevent the bloody trail of bodies - the Vampaneze Lord may be more than a match for the hunters of the dusk.</summary>

        <summary class="description">The quest for the Vampaneze Lord continues for the hunters of the dusk. Darren gets an unwelcome 
            taste of reality when he is forced to go back to school and his past catches up with him. Maturing at one fifth the rate of a 
            normal human, Darren has the looks of a fifteen year old, even though he is very much older. Vampire Prince and vampaneze killer 
            he may be, but someone has shopped him to the authorities and it's time for Darren to go back to school. But school is not the 
            only thing Darren has to come to terms with: faces from the past, the death of a clan member, a clash with a vampire hunter and
            blood-thirsty vampaneze mean Darren's past is catching up with him - fast. It's time for the allies of the night to join forces. 
            The hunt is on...</summary>
